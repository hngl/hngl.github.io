In my previous team, we cut our discussions in half by changing the rules of the Poker game. At one point we spent on average 4 hours on Backlog Refinement and 8 hours on Sprint Planning and design. 15% of the Sprint! After applying these rules, we got the estimates done in 1 hour BRM and 4 hours SPM and design.

## Agree to disagree

There will always be discussions: we care for our products and always want the best. There is however a limit beyond which more discussions do not equal  better products. Especially given that what ever you estimate will always differ from reality.

Discussions with 6 people is no replacement for poor preparation

<!-- uncertainty -->

## Rules of the Game

- Bet before any discussion. One person is allowed to introduce the vote.
- Accept a difference of one level. Time will tell which one it will be.
- Only discuss when there is a larger difference, and only then the highest and lowest can
- Revote, no agree ment -> issue is off the table
